 Machine Evolution Guiding Homeostasis Establishment of Eluding the Plethora of H. pylori

 

Our superiority and prospect
 
From our perspective, the best optimal strategy is balanced treatment rather than a fierce one. Lactobacillus acidophilus, which is a modified bacterium, with the gene of human antimicrobial peptides called LL-37 attached, has a competitive relationship with H. pylori. 
Besides, L. acidophilus has an ability to colonize in stomach  for  several  generations.  
If  we  introduce  our  modified bacterium to patients, a homeostasis among human - H. pylori - L. acidophilus will be established. 
So that H. pylori will be controlled at a low level, avoiding the risk of severe gastric disease as well as maintaining a healthy and sound balance. 
Apart from that, we have planed to put machine evolution into use. Evolutional logic, namely mutation and selection, will be defined as function and struct in program. Unlike artificial intelligence and machine learning, machine evolution is a brand-new horizon to simulate organism, in other words, is a way to create Digital Twin for our patients. If we make our prospect into reality, there is no deny that our balanced therapeutic prescription obtains a powerful assistance, and furthermore, individual medical treatment is doomed to be progressive and dynamic rather than stationary.
